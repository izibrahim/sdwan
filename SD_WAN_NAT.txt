1. Full Cone NAT (Most Friendly)

Any external host can send packets to the internal host, once the mapping is created.

No restrictions on IP or port.

Effect in SD-WAN: Very easy for vEdges, vBond, vSmart, vManage to communicate â€” tunnels come up without issues.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Address-Restricted Cone NAT

External traffic is allowed only if the source IP matches the IP the internal host has already communicated with.

Restricts by IP address only.

Effect in SD-WAN: If WAN Edge2 tries to connect from a new/different public IP, it will be blocked unless it matches the registered IP.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Port-Restricted Cone NAT

Similar to Address-Restricted, but restriction applies to both IP and Port.

External traffic is only allowed if it comes from the same IP + Port the internal device used previously.

Effect in SD-WAN: If port numbers change (e.g., manual config, firewall translation), connectivity may fail. Must match the exact source port.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Symmetric NAT (Most Strict / Problematic)

Triple restriction:

Must come from the same public IP.

Must come from the same source port.

Cannot initiate sessions from outside â€” only replies to existing sessions are allowed.

Effect in SD-WAN: Most challenging for vEdges because new control/data-plane tunnels cannot be initiated from outside. Often requires STUN/vBond assistance to traverse.
