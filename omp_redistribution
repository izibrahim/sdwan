ðŸ”¹ Default OMP Redistribution

On a WAN Edge router, OMP will automatically take these routes into OMP (no config needed):

âœ… Connected routes

âœ… Static routes

âœ… OSPF intra-area routes

âœ… OSPF inter-area routes

That means if your branch has connected LAN subnets or static routes, theyâ€™re automatically advertised into the SD-WAN fabric via OMP.

ðŸ”¹ What requires explicit configuration

The following are NOT automatically redistributed. You must configure them manually if needed:

BGP routes

OSPF external routes (type 5, type 7)

EIGRP routes

ðŸ‘‰ Why?
Because these can lead to routing loops or excessive routing information if blindly redistributed.

ðŸ”¹ Routes learned from OMP are not auto-redistributed

Even if a WAN Edge receives routes via OMP, it will not automatically inject them into local routing protocols (like OSPF/BGP toward the LAN/MPLS).

If you want that, you must configure OMP â†’ protocol redistribution manually.

ðŸ‘‰ This prevents dumping the entire SD-WAN fabric routing table into the underlay network.

ðŸ”¹ Loop prevention example (your WAN Edge1 â†’ WAN Edge2 â†’ WAN Edge3 case)

WAN Edge1 advertises OSPF routes (intra/inter-area) into OMP.

WAN Edge2 & WAN Edge3 learn them via OMP.

If WAN Edge2 & WAN Edge3 are configured to redistribute OMP â†’ BGP/OSPF, then WAN Edge3 might advertise those routes back into the fabric, causing loops (learned â†’ re-advertised â†’ comes back).
