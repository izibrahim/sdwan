## ðŸ”¹ vManage Clusters

- Cluster Size Factors:

  - Not only based on WAN Edge count.
  - Also depends on statistics and DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) data generated.
  - Cisco publishes release notes with server requirements to guide sizing.
- Cluster Options:

  - Standalone, 3-node cluster, or 6-node cluster (max today).
  - Used primarily for scale and redundancy.
- Geo-Redundancy:

  - Officially not supported due to latency requirements (â‰¤ 4 ms).
  - Technically possible with dark fiber but not recommended (risk of cluster split).
- Redundancy Model:

  - N+1 redundancy: cluster continues operating if one node fails.
- Disaster Recovery (DR):

  - Active cluster in one data center, backup in another.
  - DR mode: admin-triggered failover (not automatic).
  - Synchronization happens over DCI link (stats DB, config DB).

## ðŸ”¹ vSmart Controllers

- Scaling:

  - Up to 20 vSmarts in a domain.
  - Each supports \~5,400 DTLS control connections.
- Bottlenecks:

  - In practice, vManage scales out first before vSmart hits its limits.
  - Issues may arise more in terms of routes on a single vSmart, not overall connections.
- Future:

  - Cisco plans to expand scaling limits for WAN edge routers and clustering.

## ðŸ”¹ vBond Orchestrators

- Role:

  - Critical for onboarding: WAN Edges cannot join the fabric without vBond authentication.
  - Provides WAN edge info about vManage and vSmart controllers.
- Connection Type:

  - Connections are transient, unlike vManage/vSmart.
- Deployment Guidance:

  - Minimum 2 vBonds recommended.
  - Up to 6 vBonds supported.
  - Since they consume low server resources, itâ€™s wise not to minimize them.
- Recovery Scenarios:

  - Important during mass reconnection (e.g., after outage).

âœ… Summary:

- vManage clusters are the most sensitive: plan based on scale (WAN Edges + data load), keep them in one location, and use admin-triggered DR.
- vSmart rarely hits scaling limits today but will evolve.
- vBond is lightweight but crucial: at least 2 for resilience.


Hereâ€™s the point written clearly and aligned with the style of the other notes:

- Active-Active Datacenter Design:

  - Not supported for vManage.
  - vManage clusters operate in an Active-Standby mode (with disaster recovery setup).
  - Only the Active cluster handles management; the Standby cluster takes over when triggered by the admin.
